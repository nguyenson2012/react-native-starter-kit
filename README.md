## Why React Native Starter Kit?

As I have worked on many React native projects for my company, I have struggles doing repetitive tasks for setting up the projects, integrating 3rd-party libraries (very time-consuming and sometimes very painful :( ) and deployment. So I made this starter kit to help myself, my teammates and you guys save our precious time to focus on the business and make best apps. 

What this starter kit provides:
  - **Authentication** (using Firebase) with Facebook, Google, email and phone no. 
  - **Code-push** integration for OTA update (production lifesaver).  
  - **Rematch** as the state manager - Redux best practices without the boilerplate
  - **Well-defined structure** for aim-to-scale apps
  - **Automation scripts** of building Android/iOS apps & deploying to Playstore Alpha channel and Appstore Testflight usign Travis-ci
  - And **more** described in below sections
